  caveats <<~EOS
    Streamlink 8.0 or newer and a compatible media player must be installed separately.

    The Gatekeeper quarantine flag is cleared automatically after install
    (Stream GUI RS is open source but not yet notarized with Apple). If macOS
    still reports the app as damaged, run:

      xattr -cr "/Applications/Stream GUI RS.app"
  EOS
end
